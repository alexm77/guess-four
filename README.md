# Guess four game

### Description 
This is the classic game where you have to guess four digits. For bonus points it includes a hard mode where the game will tell you how many digits you got right, how many are misplaced aand how many are wrong, but without indicating their position (warning: this mode is actually hard).

### Why?
I wrote this to (re)learn Angular. 

### What?
It is a rather simple application, but it touches on the following:
  - components
  - routing and guards
  - sharing data by using a service
  - i18n/l10n
  - a dash of Angulat Material

It doesn't have any tests. It doesn't have support for gestures, so tooltips that won't work on mobile.
